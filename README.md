 Develop a UDP-based client-server socket program for transferring a large message. Here, the message transmitted from the client to server is read from a large file. The message is split into short data-units which are sent by using stop-and-wait flow control. Also, a data-unit sent could be damaged with some error probability. Verify if the file has been sent completely and correctly by comparing the received file with the original file. Measure the message transfer time and throughput for various sizes of dataunits. Also, measure the performance for various error probabilities and for the error-free scenario.  
 
Choose appropriate values for parameters such as data unit size and error probability. You can simulate errors according to the frame error probability. You are free to implement the ARQ in your own way, but with stop-and-wait. For example, you may want to avoid TIMEOUTs and handle retransmissions in some other way (you may want to choose negative acknowledgement). Repeat the experiment several times and plot the average values in a report with a brief description of results, assumptions made, etc. Include the following performance figures in your report:
